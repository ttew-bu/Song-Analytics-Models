# SpotiPy_Models
This is the work behind the dataset and the model notebooks for what I want to put into the SpotiPy webapp. I utilized the web APIs for both Genius and Spotify to get the job done. 

By the end, this repo will include the collection notebooks, an explanation of the workflow, the cleaning notebook, and my model notebooks. The intended final models here are going to be a sentiment analysis model to see how positive a song is and a lyric analyzer that takes text and predicts what genre a song would fall under. The labels for the lyric analyzer are determined via a LDA model on the genre column to reduce the number of genres down.
