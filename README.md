# SpotiPy_Models
This is the work behind the dataset and the model notebooks for what I want to put into the SpotiPy webapp. One challenge with this project was that I wanted to use the Genius API/Spotify API packages instead of the requests Library, which forced me to do break down the workflow at first (genre data via Jupyter notebook and lyrics via Python script). I then decided to consolidate the whole process into one workbook for the sake of ease

By the end, this repo will include the collection notebooks, an explanation of the workflow, the cleaning notebook, and my model notebooks. The intended final models here are going to be a sentiment analysis model to see how positive a song is and a lyric analyzer that takes text and predicts what general genre a song would fall under.
