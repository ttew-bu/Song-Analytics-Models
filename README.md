# SpotiPy_Models
This is the work behind the dataset and the model notebooks for what I want to put into the SpotiPy webapp. One challenge with this project was that I wanted to use the Genius API/Spotify API packages instead of the requests Library, which forced me to do one step of the process (genre data via Jupyter notebook and lyrics via Python script).
