I have days where I hate my job
This little town and the whole world too
And last Sunday when my Bengals lost
Lord, it put me in a bad mood

[Verse 2]
I have moments when I curse the rain
But then complain when the sun's too hot
I look around at what everyone has
And I forget about all I've got

[Chorus 1]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can

[Chorus 2]
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kid's dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Verse 3]
Got some friends who would be here fast
I could call 'em any time of day
Got a brother who's got my back
Got a mama who I swear's a saint
[Verse 4]
Got a brand new rod and reel
Got a full week off this year
Dad had a close call last spring
It's a miracle he's still here

[Chorus 1]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can

[Chorus 2]
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kids dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Chorus 2]
Woh, my old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And even my bad days ain't that bad
Yeah, I'm a lucky man

3,3,Alan Jackson,Where I Come From,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']","[Verse 1]
Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said, ""Sir you broke the limit
In thit rusty old truck""
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab
And the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
[Chorus]
Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 3]
I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint
And I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am
Back home We like the girls
That sing soprano

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven

Staring up at heaven

4,4,Tim McGraw,Nothin' To Die For,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']","[Verse 1]
Stopped to have a few at five now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this this week had a friend ask you for your keys
You said 'no I'm fine'
You sure do act like you don't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass might be the ones you take with you

[Chorus]
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for

[Verse 2]
So what's the harm in a little fun
'Cause you're off to work before the sun every day
And the inbox outbox locks you in and the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says 'man your numbers they don't lie'
The graveyard's full of folks that didn't have time to die

[Chorus]
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for
[Verse 3]
Straight through that guardrail up into that white light
You hear a sweet voice saying just this side of the other side
Just this side of the other side

You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends

He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

[Verse 2]
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, ""Please let my crops and children grow""
'Cause that's all he's ever known
[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

And he takes the tractor another round. (Another round)
Another round (Another round), another round

8,8,Montgomery Gentry,Daddy Won't Sell The Farm,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'modern country rock', 'redneck']","His cows get loose and run right through the fast food parking lots
And Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls
When they're downwind from his hogs
When his tractor backs up traffic, the reception ain't too warm
The city's growing around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm
You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

He worked and slaved in '68, he bought these fields and trees
He raised his corn and a big red barn and a healthy family
He learned to love the woodlands, he can't stand to do them harm. There's concrete all
Around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

One day he's gonna leave it all to me and I'll start my own branch of the family tree
They'll get the message written on the roof of the barn, Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm

Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one; got beef, bust yo' gun

Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarter back in the back of classes
She was the whiz kid in horned rim glasses

It's been a long time since I've been around
Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car
She said, ""I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever.""
It took a second to put it all together and I said

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my

If you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good

She said hop in let's go for a spin
Tell me whatcha been doing boy and where you been
I said I write songs, you probably didn't know, but I
Finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, ""What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money.""
Imagine little miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue
I said you've come a long way since graduation

You've surpassed everyone's expectations

Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and they'll fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me

Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)

It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, ""Love to rendezvous""
She asked me, ""What we were gonna do?""
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Nine was the time

She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh-oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (Oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that

Endless ringing off my phone
When you feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me

23,23,Blake Shelton,Some Beach,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'oklahoma country']","[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere
[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Maybe tonight
We could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love
'Cos you never know when life will leave us
I want to take in all the beauty here
Oh, let the world around us just disappear

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day

Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now (Yes)
And yes, we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now (Uh!)
Superseded every one of my little struggles and (Huh!)
Failure has never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

Oh, together we made it (You see we did it, niggas!)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road (To the riches)
On the road (To the ghetto)
On the road (In the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
On the road (ride with me!)
On the road (we come to get it)
On the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!

Oh, together we made it (You see we did it, niggas!)

On the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Look, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
Shit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children
Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come
Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
Sing it!

Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time
No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride
What a beautiful rideEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 1]
It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world

'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??

Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

And all of them coming anonymously, so they leave no trail

Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots

I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight

""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""

So she takes and she takes, she takes and she takes
She understands when she gives it away

Man I gotta get outta this pain
Man I gotta get outta this town
Outta this town & out of L.A

She got a gun she calls the lucky one
She left a note right by the phone
Don't leave a message 'cause this ain't no home
And she cried and she cried, and she cried and she cried
She cried so long her tears ran dry
Then she laughed and she laughed, she laughed and she laughed
Cause she knew she was never comin' back

It's all too much for her to take
She can't be sure just where it ends
Or where the good life begins

So she took a train, she took a train
To a little old town without a name

She met a man, he took her in
But fed her all the same bullshit again
'Cause he lied and he lied, and he lied and he lied
He lied like a salesman selling flies
So she screamed and she screamed, and she screamed and she screamed
It's a different place but the same old thing

It's all I love, it's all I hate
It's all too much for me to take
I can't be sure where it begins
Or if the good life lies within

It's hard for me, given the upheaval of the world right now, to talk about silly things like pop music. But that's where we are, that's my job, and that's what I'm gonna do. But first, let me take a selfie.

[A clip of ""#SELFIE"" by The Chainsmokers plays]

Yes, The Chainsmokers. Or as they will always be known to me: The #SELFIE Guys. I am more shocked about their comeback than I was for Mike Posner's, and Posner was gone for three times as long. #SELFIE was just from 2014. And what makes it so shocking is that #SELFIE is the definiton of a novelty hit. It was exactly the kind of song that I should be able to dismiss as a blip from two idiots I would never see again. Of course, I've been wrong about the career prospects of a lot of people, like, say, LMFAO, but they had their second song in the same year. If The Chainsmokers couldn't immediately follow up on their big hit, how on Earth could they return two years later?

[A clip of ""Roses"" by The Chainsmokers plays]

I'm annoyed by a lot of things about their comeback, but most of all, I'm annoyed that I have to start taking them seriously as artists. The #SELFIE Guys are, in a quantifiable sense, the biggest act of the year. The Chainsmokers. If I could go back to 2014 and tell my past self that 2016 was the year of The Chainsmokers, past me would probably say, ""Wow, 2016 must be the worst in history!"" And I'd tell him, ""Calm down! Things aren't that bad, hahaha, hahaha, also start investing in Xanax. And I mean now, not later.""

The big question is: ""How do you turn #SELFIE into a sustainable career?"" Good question! Well, apparently by switching from making terrible novelty EDM to terrible generic EDM... that's one possible way.

[A clip of ""Don't Let Me Down"" by The Chainsmokers plays]
This was  one of the biggest hits of the year, and it is a disaster. Its an incoherent mish-mash of the worst sounds in pop music, and it of course was everywhere. The Black Eyed Peas may have been banished, but will.i.am's influence remains. But even that was dwarfed by today's song, which is A.) their attempt at a love song and B.) one where they actually sing. That's right, The #SELFIE Douches are now singing.
[A clip of The Chainsmokers performing ""Closer"" live plays]
Oh... boy...
Calvin Harris, I apologize.
[A clip of ""Summer"" by Calvin Harris plays]
Your voice is lovely, like the song of a beautiful wood thrush wafting on a summer breeze.
And because nothing in this world makes sense anymore, this song is huge. It is the best charting hit of the year.
And, not speaking for myself, just taking the temperature of the room here, seems like the backlash is kicking in, but hard!And goddamn, I'm not surprised. 'Cause, Jesus Christ, who on Earth thought this was a good idea? I daresay there's not a more disliked song in the world right now!

Am I really gonna be the guy to stand up for this? Fine, screw it. I like the song. Quite a bit, if I'm being honest, but hear me out; I totally get why this song is controversial. There are a lot of problems with it. A lot! I mean, first off, Jesus Christ, it's a duet... with Halsey!

[A clip of ""New Americana"" by Halsey plays]

And, speaking of artists who made a terrible first impression! I was introduced to Halsey last year with her first mainstream success, ""New Americana,"" an anthem for the new millennial generation.
Yeah, listen to that. Feel the creeping dread of the sweeping tide of change!

[Halsey]
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana

We smoke weed, legally! Watch us, obeying the law!

[Halsey]
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana

That's not even your generation's music! If anything, those are two artists whose influences are being felt less and less! That has nothing to do with your generation, you're just trying to make the rest of us feel old! Yeah, every impression I got was that Halsey was like if Kesha was trying to be Lorde, which is not a combo that works.

[A clip of ""Colors"" by Halsey plays]

But I gathered that was a fluke, and she's actually much more an anonymous singer than that, like she's not trying to make a statement, she's just another boring singer.
So yeah, I don't like her, she was another demerit against ""Closer"". But I do like it anyway. Mostly, I like that it's such a songwriterly song. I don't know the last time we had a hit song packed with this much lyrical detail and intense emotion. It sketches a very full portrait of a very complex relationship between two people. And that level of detail is really remarkable in a day and age where you can have a hit song that just says ""Pineapple, pen, apple.""
[A clip of ""Pen Pineapple Apple Pen"" by PIKOTARO plays]
Or ""You ugly, you ugly.""

[A clip of ""JuJu On That Beat (TZ Anthem)"" by Zay Hilfigerrr plays]

And in it, the two of them are playing specific roles in the song. They're two long broken up exes reconnecting despite the years of tension between them.
Todd: I, I should really just play the chorus here, because it is just fantastic!
Andrew and Halsey: So baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford [Todd cringes a little on that line.]
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder [Todd cringes harder.]
We ain't ever getting older
Todd: Okay, not that fantastic. Go back.
Andrew and Halsey: Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder [Record scratching noise]

Sorry. I do keep an actual record player down here [Reaches down to grab it] for uh, for when I need that sound. But um, anyway, yeah. I think it's important to say that lyrical detail is great. It adds a lot. But, not all details help paint the picture you're trying to create. For example...

[A clip of ""Hey, Soul Sister"" by Train plays]
...I didn't need to know about Pat Monahan's manscaping habits.
Pat: My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
Not important to the story.

Back to ""Closer""
Andrew and Halsey: Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Todd (VO): Now, for example, the shoulder tattoo, that's an important detail, it adds to the scene.
Andrew and Halsey: Backseat of your Rover

The Land Rover. Well, you know, it's part of the setting.

Andrew and Halsey: That I know you can't afford

Can she pay for it?  ...Um?  I, I guess it adds a level of familiarity with each other? ...But the mattress! Oh boy.

Andrew and Halsey: Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

Do I need to know that there's a mattress? Yeah, that's uh, it's pretty important. But I don't need to know where she got the mattress, I don't need to know who she got the mattress from, and I certainly don't need to know where the person she got the mattress from is from! And it happens right before the most important line!

Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older

That's what we were building up to! Except right before we hit peak momentum... mattress?! Boulder?! What?!

Video of a bicycle race

We're right at what should be the chorus's triumphant climax, and then...

The song plays over a cyclist riding a bike...

Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder
...and he falls off.
Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder


This is the clumsiest, most useless, most jarringly unnecessary detail I've ever seen a writer use! And I've read [Cover of The Da Vinci Code by...] Dan Brown! And the fact that they're both singing the chorus together?

Andrew and Halsey: Baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

That also raises some questions. Can they both not afford a Land Rover? Do they both have shoulder tattoos, are they both mattress thieves?  But, the fact that it's a duet makes some interesting things happen. Most especially, I like the fact that despite how they're sharing this moment together... these two people are having wildly different experiences!

Andrew: Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue
But I'm okay

I mean, the first thing the guy sings is basically...""Go away, I hate you!"" [sticks out his tongue]

Andrew: Tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

Meanwhile, let's see how she feels about this rekindling of that old flame.

Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane

Why did you leave him? Hmm... Well, he hates all your friends!

Andrew: But I hope I never see them...

I'm not saying it's his fault or your fault, I'm just saying it's a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes. And of course, there's this.

Andrew: I drink too much, and that's an issue

Just a guess. But then again, by his own words, it's okay.

Andrew: But I'm okay

So, I mean, don't worry about that obviously.I mean, focus on what's bringing the two of you together again.

Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you

Ah, yes! The one thing that proves a relationship can work forever: looks! It's like they say, ""Beauty is bone deep."" I, I don't know how to break it to ya... but I wouldn't count on him calling you the day after.

Andrew: Four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar

I mean, you haven't spoken in four years, which is not a good sign on its own. Plus, I get the feeling you might've forgotten some bad memories. I mean, Christ, you've re-met at a bar! The two of you only got back together because he's drunk! He drinks too much! It's an issue!

Halsey: I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car, and

This girl has completely missed that this guy's carrying more baggage than  a Samsonite store. Christ, the couple in  ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" were more on the same page!

Kimbra: Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over

I think these two crazy kids are gonna work it out! [laughs] Ah, young love.

Andrew: I know it breaks your heart

And even when they sing ""It breaks your heart,"" one's being completely sincere and the other's completely sarcastic. I mean, I guess it's kind of a dick move that the Chainsmokers wrote the girl as like being, [sarcastic tone] ""Wow, you're so hot,"" and... he never has to meet her halfway, he's just like ""You're a bitch,"" and she's just like, [sarcastic] ""God, sorry I'm crazy!""

Halsey: I was insane

But, it, it still feels real, you know? The, the willful delusion of it all. See, it is a good song.

Halsey: Stay, and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Todd exhales] O-okay, I got questions again.
Halsey: In Tucson, okay
First off, Boulder? Tucson? What the hell was the two of you's relationship?! Were you traveling around the country like Bonnie and Clyde on a crazy mattress-stealing spree Secondly, ""that Blink-182 song""?
Halsey: Play that Blink-182 song

Which one, the one with the dick jokes?

[A clip of ""What's My Age Again?"" by Blink-182 plays]

Mark Hoppus: The state looks down on sodomy

I know, I know, I'm sorry, [Clips of ""Stay Together for the Kids""...] I know they became a real grown-up band eventually. [...and ""All the Small Things""] But to me, they'll always be the [Album cover of Enema of the State] ""Haha, that porn star's gonna stick a finger up your butt"" band. Which, which song are they even talking about? [Looks on his phone] Let's see here. [Headline reading ""How Blink-182's 'I Miss You' Inspired The Chainsmokers and Halsey's 'Closer'""] Oh yeah, ""I Miss You."" Yeah that's a good song. I like that song.

Tom deLonge: Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head

Not sure it's all that romantic though. Not sure ""Don't waste your time on me"" is the lyric you really wanna hear when reconnecting. But yeah it does have some of the same  wistful vibe that this song has, you know, I'll give it that. Of course, if anything... the Blink-182 song she's talking about is still ""What's My Age Again?"" because that song is indeed about never getting older.

Mark: I never wanna act my age


And be honest, the situation will probably end up for these two looking like the same way it did for Blink. Embarrassing and regrettable in hindsight. This hookup is a mistake, you guys.  But I do have one other question: [Screenshot from Wikipedia page] Why is this being labelled a millennial anthem? 'Cause I've seen that a lot. I've been thinking about it, and... I think it's that a lot of the unnecessary jarring details are about... one major thing.
Andrew: Moved to the city in a broke down car and


Can't buy a mattress, Daddy bought us a car, this is the new Americana. We're all broke. And we're gonna be a lot broker pretty soon, probably! [starts nervously laughing again, but quickly composes himself] Oh no, no, no politics, no politics, no politics. [sighs]


Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older


Yeah, regardless of all its deep, serious flaws, I like it. I mean she's singing way too hard, and he can't sing at all, but... it works together, you know? Like Sonny & Cher, who are also both terrible singers; don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older

Look, I'm not saying it's a perfect song, I'm not sure it's even a good song. But if there's anything that sums up the mess of anger, optimism, confusion, and the desire to turn back time that I'm feeling right now, it's this one. Chainsmokers, ""Closer,""... thumbs up.


Andrew and Halsey: No we ain't ever gettin' older

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Verse 1:]
The moment was custom-made to order
I was riding with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
And like children do
She started playing twenty questions
But I never could of guessed one would touch me to my soul

[Chorus:]
She said
Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we going there to visit
Or are we going there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

La, da, da
Da, de, de, de, de

[Verse 2:]
Well, I won't lie
I pulled that car right over
And I sat there on the shoulder
Trying to dry my misty eyes
And I whispered
Lord, I wanna thank you for my children
Cause your innocence that fills them
Often takes me by surprise like

[Chorus:]
Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we goin' there to visit
Or are we goin' there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

[Bridge:]
Well, I thought about it later on
And a smile came to my face
And when I tucked her in to bed
I got down on my knees and prayed

[Chorus:]
Lord, when I get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
I don't wanna come to visit
Cause I'm coming home to stay?
And I can't wait to see my family
And meet Jesus face to face
And do you think, Lord
You could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

Mmmm
Can I help pour out the rain?
Can I help pour out the rain?

Now you didn't hear any of this from me
But things aren't always what they seem
Brace yourself
This may come as a shock to you

Girls lie, too
We don't care how much money you make
What you drive or what you weigh
Size don't matter anyway
Girls lie, too
Don't think you're the only ones
Who bend it, break it, stretch it some
We learn from you
Girls lie, too

We can't wait to hear about your round of golf
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall
And we like Hooters for their hotwings too
Other guys never cross our minds
We don't wonder what it might be like
How could it be any better than it is with you
Yeah, girls lie, too
We always forgive and forget
The cards and flowers you never sent
Will never be brought up again

You mean the world to me
Baby baby baby babe
You know I love you (uh huh Come on yea yea)
And I wanna be together when you runaway (Its NB Ryders)
Just me and you (Same Klick new title)
Just you and me
Will you runaway with me

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day a happy and complete man
Cuz in the palm of my hands
Everything that I dreamed for and more
And you know I'm down for yours
Forever and life the reason why I made you my wife is because
You see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally
And even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance
And that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me
And now my life is satisfied and complete visions are coming true
Yea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying ""I do""
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over
Again
Nah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy

(Chorus)
We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do
I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you
And even though it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here not really knowing what to do
But I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
I promise girl I'll put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But thats what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
Cuz I know deep inside you feel the same way
You could tell me what u want but I could read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put ya hand in mine
I get excited everytime you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So any time your feeling lonely inside
We could runaway together and leave this world behind

(Chorus)
We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can't we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine
Holdin up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak anymore you went your own way
If thats what loves about then I was mislead
Go ahead and take your time if thats what you need
My loves for you forever my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask my self should I be strong
And wait or move on to someone else
I know you still love me I could feel it inside
You always kept it real no games no lies
If your ever feelin lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll run away girl

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me

Broken heart again

Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee that I'll be fine

[Chorus]
(No more pain), no more pain
(No more pain), no more pain
(No drama), no more drama in my life
(No more in my life), no one's gonna make me hurt again

[Verse 2]
Why'd I play the fool?
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

(No more), no more game
No more game messin' with my mind (no drama)

Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind
Go 'head

Ooh, it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (free from all the pain)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)
So find your happiness

Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose

The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

[Verse 2]
The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, is there healing?
In your name I find meaning
[Post-Chorus]
So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be okay

The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church!"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason
[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne & Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why
[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve63EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone

Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

In you, I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you, I hear a song
I look to you

About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door
And every road that I've taken, mmm
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gon' make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

In you, I can be strong

My walls are coming down on me (Coming down on me)

Defeat is calling (Set me free)

Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these

Okay, dawg, give—come on

Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

Look at Em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?

""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""

Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)

Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend

Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)

You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride

[Chorus]
So how did you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try, I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go, go, go again

[Verse 2]
You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
Every time that you look at me
You only hear half of what I say
And you're always showing up too late
And I know that I should say goodbye, but it's no use
Can't be with or without you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Chorus]
So how did you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try, I know I can't quit (I can't quit)

We're falling together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go, go, go again (Again)

And again (and again), and again (and again), and again
I threw all of your stuff away
And I cleared you out of my head
And I tore you out of my heart

Swore that I'd never let you back in (Oh)

Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mothers hands are serving meals
In a café on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
(Let's talk)

[Verse 2]
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad
[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind

Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

We'll go flying down the highway with my arms around you singing Born To Run

Like I got sun on my face and the rain ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Oh It is almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight

Well you got your good looks - uh huh
And you got your style
And I'd drown here in this ccean
Just to have you float my boat for a while
I got a reputation - uh huh
Don't you worry about that
Just give me a chance and we'll never gonna ever look back
And it feels just like it should

Like I got sun on my face and rain that ain't never going to fall

Maybe Romeo gets the girl this time
I guess everybody gets the chance to shine
And tonight is mine

I know what happens when she drinks Patrón
Her closet's missing half the things she bought

You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kind of star""

Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, ""Ooh, he can get it"" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin! We both goin' to where you livin'!
Eh-HAH!! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it

This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

How did you know I've been thinking about you and dreaming of your kiss?

Somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell 'em what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out
Yes we were meant to be
Girl there's no doubt
And if it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, Oh, I'll breathe in, and breathe outEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

I could live with losing everything
But I would die without your kiss

Will burn out, you're wrong

All I do is smile

Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me

But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)

Everything gone be gravy later, that's right
This the time when we take time to remember
All the loved ones we lost in the struggle you know
I dedicate this to my brother Hollywood, Toby, Bam
My dog Itchy and Lil Trav, I dedicate this to the struggle
Everybody in the county jail, state penn, check it out

[Trick Daddy]
If it wasn't for bad luck, hell I guess that a nigga wouldn't have none
But when I think about it, what would I be without my gun
How could I, get away from the po-po's, if a, nigga couldn't run
And how was I given a daughter when I always prayed for a son
Life is crazy ain't it, sometimes I even think the same thing
I've been waiting on freeing the ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, Taterhead done lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love
So I pray for the better days, face the bomb had a run-a-ways
And, I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays, it's crazy ain't it

[Hook: LaTocha Scott]
Just like the soldiers, that ain't coming home this year
Just like the fellas, in prison, we miss you so much for real
What about the children, who ran away, that ain't coming home today
Well here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most a thug holiday
Just like 'em, just like 'em, just like 'em, a thug holiday - 2x

Here go one for, all these killings and all these conflicts in religion
See the Muslims, Jews and Christians but know they are all God's children
There's only, one him, plus ain't none of y'all confronting him
So blind in our own minds we wouldn't even know God if we was in front of him
And, I read your books know all your remixes to the bible
What about a, verse for the thugs curled with drugs and survival
That's asking chapels naming Martin, Malcolm and Farrakhan
In all my history books, only one died was the Americans
And, that's point of my, who's responsible for Vietnam
And, hold on there's more, we had two World Wars
And, how come the judges make more than the teachers is making
When they the ones raising all the taxes and got us fighting for education
Life is crazy ain't it

[Hook]
So many tears, through out the years
Somebody tell me what's going on
And so many liiives, but only God knows
About the pain deep inside
It gets so hard, you got to keep your head up
I know you're fed up, but stay strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, thug holiday
Just like 'em, just like 'em, just like 'em, a thug holiday - 2x

[LaTocha Scott]
This is for my people in the ghetto
I'm calling out, calling out
To all my thugs in the ghetto
Calling out, calling out
It gets hard sometimes, but you
Got to keep your head up, and be strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, a thug holiday

135,135,Jennifer Hanson,Beautiful Goodbye,['country dawn'],"It's like the most amazing sunset
You've ever seen
There's never another quite the same
It just falls into some eternal sea
Like the end of a movie that makes you cry
You're sad when it's over
But you're glad you had
That moment that moved you deep inside

Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye

I'm standing here watching you drive away
We were so grown up about it all
But how will it look in the light of day?
I miss you already, but don't turn around
It's funny how you know when it just won't work
And how letting go can make the sweetest sound

Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye
So ironic, it's so confusing
To do the right thing and be losin
I'm always stuck with choosin
Ain't that just like life?

Hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah

Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye
Goodbye, yeah

Motel, sitting in the dark
Empty room like an empty heart
Lovers stop, but they never stay
They don't look back as they drive away
Maybe I can fix this broken neon light
Fill in the cracks and paint it bright
That maybe love will stop here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And if she knocks on my door
I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes
And I know I'll be everything that she sees in me
More than I ever thought I could be, but...

These are the days
When all that I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever
Living in the in-between
I'm stuck here in a place without love
And I just can't let it stay this way
But for now, I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days

I gotta use this lonely time
To change the picture in my frame of mind
Outside the window, there's a sunny day
I wanna feel it on my face
You and I
We're out here looking for the same thing
An end to all the wondering
Waiting for someone to share this feeling

Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

Beauty will last when spiraled down

Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

[Intro: Alejandro Sanz]
Ay payita mia, guardate la poesia
Guardate la alegria pa' ti

[Verso 1: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos
Y hablando de ella
Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios
[Verso 2: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
Ay, amor, me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay, amor, es una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adiós

[Verso 3: Alejandro Sanz]
No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mi que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo sólo soy un hombre muy arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido
[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

[Outro: Shakira]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando, perdón
Yo ya no voy a llorar hoy por ti23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

They make me sick
I know I feel you, that's why we gotta stick together
Yep, yep, yep, know it

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Verse 1]
He was doing 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double O, bumping Islay
He was getting kind of close, kind of touch-ay
Because he had a little too much Hennessy
He told me that he wanna go home
With me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""Boo, I don't really know though""
He got closer to me, it started getting deep
He had me in a zone
When he started to show me things I never saw before
Baby was smooth, but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a cool, but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick
[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Verse 2]
In the 6 now, so hot
Gotta pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinking 'bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this?
Kind of funny, but I was not even nervous
Well, his slick-ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak, his body was calling me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway, it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool, but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this
[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit (Crazy)
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit (Crazy)
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

I want you and I'm hating it
Hot when you touch the tip

Oh, you make me sick

He goes by E. Diddy but his name is Earl
Cocks his hat to the side in his Grandma's ride
Pumpin' nothin' but bass

He says things like, 'Dawg, are you down with that'
And, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'
And I feel so doggone outta place

When he says
'Holler back when you get back home'
I say, 'The only holler back that I know is'

(Chorus)
In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

Take a left off the Interstate
Go ten miles
Take a right on Farm Road 99
And just roll 'til the blacktop ends
'Ya see Mary Jo rockin' that front porch swing
Bikini top and them cut-off jeans
And that's where Hillbilly Heaven begins

Ah, she'll pour 'ya some of that cherry wine
Boy, you're guaranteed to have yourself

Hey, Dirty!

So I glanced at the girls, girls glanced at me
I whispered in their ear: ""Wanna be with me?""
You wanna look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just dance if you caught up in the holy ghost trance
If you stop I'ma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
F.B.I., don't you be watching me
I don't want no problems, ‘cause I'll put you down
In the ground where you can not be found
I'm just Dirt Dog trying to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey!

Recognize I'm a fool and you love me!
None of you, NUH, better look at me funny
NUH, you know my name, now give me my money!

That's how I like you, girl!
[Verse 3: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Nigga playing in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out, let me hold it tight
You looking at my wrist saying ""It's so nice!""
The price bitch is diamonds, shining disco light
Well, you better help me solve my problem
Or I'ma get this money and rob them
Lucky Dog when I won the Lotto
Ran up on my car for carrying Rollo
But hold on, you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt and Dirt bust your ass
Stop annoying me! Yeah, I play my music loud
It takes the Bastard – Ol' Dirty – to move the crowd
They say, ""He had his dick in his mouth.""
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house
Now give me my money!

Somewhere we went wrong

Now I've tried and tried again

Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends

That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

I didn't understand it
Oh girl, why me?
I had no choice
What was best for us
Was to terminate our love and be free

Most stared up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said, ""I heard that you're a heartbreaker""

Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker

[Verse 1: Akon]
See, I'm that type of guy you won't love
I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy your daddy won't let you go out
Cause he thinks I sell drugs

I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do

Gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, let's stay caked up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like I are the dude
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Akon]
See I'm that type of guy that like kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
If your bougie just start tripping

I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
That everywhere I go I can find a pretty ho
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough

That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV

She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don't matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
You're not for sure
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes
And I realize being with you girls bring more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to
And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time, till the break of day
I won't let her ever leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Anna Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say, ""Look at me now""

And momma I love pussy, but I ain't lickin
Now prepare yourself for a smooth dickin
You don't want it girl? You don't know, what you missin

I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and ""that's too bad""

Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom

Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom

She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan

Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl

She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up

They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

Together you and me
Forsaking them all

Deep in the night
And by the light of day
It always looks the same
True love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

Chorus:
When I said I do, I meant that I will
Til' the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind, when I said I do

Well this whole world keeps changin'
And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand
Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (so much more)
Than a woman and a man

After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams

I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

Where the camera fell in love with her face

And in the aftermath, that small-time town was hers

They only thought she entertains is
Where they are and where she is now

She knows you don't get where you are going
Unless you got something they have not got

And the young girls scream out loud

Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us

[Verse 3]
We talk about living, babies, and women
All that we've lost and all we've been giving
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done
Drink one more cold one, come morning get up
And we roll

Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such

One out of the grey

It took her breath away
She said she didn't believe

And all the stars fade

Meet me once again
Down off Lake Michigan
Where we could feel the storm blowing down with the wind

All the game that you were spittin', You know that you was trippin'
Never thought to see me dippin' but I had to get missin'
I'm tired of you stressin' me, why don't you let it be
Comin around testin' me, fuckin' wit me mentally
Goodbye, don't wanna see your face no more
So long, pack your bags want you out the door
Cause, every time that I play this raw game(?)
Time and time again it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain it's gonna rain it's gonna rain

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Oh shit
There you go again flippin' on me
One minute we the shit next minute you shittin' on me
So what's the problem huh?
No wait, let me guess, gimme some space
And some place to get a load of your chest, no better yet
You don't get enough attention at home, and when I'm gone
I don't even think to pickup the phone, I'm dead wrong
Now your fed up, packin' my stuff, fuckin' my head up
And I see it in your face right now you wish I shut up
[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Verse 3: Jonell]
If you don't understand where I'm comin' from
Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one
All the games you played and now you lied
You're not the one, for me no more so baby bye bye
Pack yo' bags and get to steppin'
You got to let it go you need to stop trippin'
(I hope you don't think I'll let you back in)
Cause you's a fool

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!

I was gutter when ya met me, gutter when ya left me
Gutter when ya came back, face it nothin' can change that
Not romance nor marriage counselin'

Find me a room burn up an ounce and
Waitin' for my baby to call forgive it all
On some break up to makeup shit givin' me draws
I adore mi amor, but every time she choose to go to war
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Verse 1]
On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again
We know

[Pre-Chorus]
So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
[Chorus]
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams, see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day, this misery must go on
[Chorus]
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on

Now, here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now, can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days

You gave me a smile that I could never forget

Just want you to know

198,198,Jason Michael Carroll,Where I'm From,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country pop', 'country road', 'modern country rock']","On a three-hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames and
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks a Ford and the tractor's green
And ""Amazing Grace"" is what we sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much but it's where I'm from
And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
Amazing Grace
It's where I'm from

Uh, You know what it is what it is when we do what we do

[Verse 1]
If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me how low will a bad girl go
She probably pick it up drop it down real slow
Either that or she's upside down on the pole
That's when I grab the knot throw it up in the sky
Let it come down slow watch it all fly
Front to the back then side to the side
Then we head back to my crib for the night
That's how it goes down, all night long
She whisper in my ear says she loves my song
This Is Why I'm Hot, she got it on her phone
Top ten download number one ring tone
I'm in my zone tell me what's good, what it be
Can't say I'm what you want but I got what you need
All night, it's alright
We can dance but ya gotta keep it up a lil somethin

You say you like it rough won't you let me smack it up
Palm on your ass that's if you let me touch
I don't care 'bout your breast you can be an A cup
I know what I like, and baby that's below the waist
I'm a baller, baby I'll hold us safe
I got about ten lawyers to blow the case
So we don't gotta worry 'bout those who hate
I'm like the 2-0-0-7 Nino
Dropped a few G's on my shirt like Gino
Homey don't act like you know what I mean
Oh see I'm the freshest motherfucker on the scene though

When I get off of work on Friday after working like a dog all week
I go to meet the boys for a cold one at a little joint up the street
They got a jukebox in the corner full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters is the first thing I always do

[Chorus]
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang

[Verse 2]
Well, I like a lot of kinds of music, I try to keep an open mind
Depending on the mood to strike me if I'm gonna stay till closing time
So when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang
I know I'm gonna have to hear it 'cause I gotta have some Hank to hang

[Chorus]
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins

I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

[Chorus: All]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

[Verse 2: Joe & 98°]
I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life

See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way

[Chorus: 98° with ad-libs from Mariah Carey & Joe]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life

Somebody listen please
It used to be so hard being me

Living in the shadow

But now that I am wide awake
My chains are finally free
Don't feel sorry for me

That it's safe outside to come alive in my identity

There's so much more to me you haven't seen

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know

As I stop, and I wait, and I think
That I never met someone who make me feel like I'm ready to love
So I gotta do what I gotta do just to keep you
Keep you here with me, baby
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you, boo
And I can't go a day without your lovin'
Baby, I can't live without you
[Verse 3: Brian]
I know that you know (Oh)
No matter where you want it, baby
Ain't no ifs, whats or buts or maybes
And I know that one day you'll see, hey
He can't really love you like I love you (Woah)

[Chorus: Jagged Edge & (Brian)]
He can't love you like I love you
Baby, you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man (He can't love you, no, he can't love you, no, woah)
And do the things to you like I can (Woah)
I'm telling you, he can't love you like I love you (No, he can't, can't love you)
Baby, you know it too (I know he can't love you, I know he can't do the things that I can will do, baby)
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man (I'm so sorry he can't be a man, baby)

Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name, never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

[Verse 2: John Michael Montgomery]
Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out

[Chorus 1: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

[Verse 3: John Michael Montgomery]
And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life

[Chorus 2: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad, kisses and hugs everyday
[Verse 4: John Michael Montgomery]
Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off

[Chorus 3: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
'Cause He was there in my old house and held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch, the night that my parents diedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, Shorty)

[Verse 1]
Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P (P!)

I don't know what you heard about me (Woo!)

No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Bridge]
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo!)

Yeah, in Hollywood they say, ""There's no b'ness like show b'ness""

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better

In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment
[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)346EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
Anybody can you tell me what it means?
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

Checking how my hair and nails look

I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home
I see your face
When I hear my favorite song
Should I send a email at home
You're the number one topic on the phone

Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah
[Chorus]
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

I’m falling into the same dreams
We run away

[Chorus]
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game, aha
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Made my skin a little bit thicker

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

Through living in denial

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back

Punk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit
What you was gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?
2Pac, Biggie – shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 1: The Game]
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide
I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 2: The Game]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 3: The Game]
Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people

Heaven bend to take my hand
And lead me through the fire
Be the long awaited answer
To a long and painful fight
Truth be told, I've tried my best
But somewhere 'long the way
I got caught up in all there was to offer
And the cost was so much more than I could bear

Though I've tried
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me ""I told you so""

We all begin with good intent
When love was raw and young
We believe that we can change ourselves
The past can be undone
But we carry on our back the burden time always reveals
In the lonely light of morning
In the wound that would not heal
It's the bitter taste of losing everything
That I've held so dear

I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me ""I told you so""
Oh

Heaven bend to take my hand
I've nowhere left to turn
I'm lost to those I thought were friends
To everyone I know
Oh, they turn their heads embarrassed
Pretend that they don't see
That it's one missed step, one slip before you know it
And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed

Though I've tried
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here

237,237,Brad Paisley,Celebrity,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']","[Verse 1]
Someday I'm gonna be famous
Do I have talent? well no
These days you don't really need it
Thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel
Can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari
On my way to rehab

[Chorus]
Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity

[Verse 2]
I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters
When things don't go my way
And I'll get community service
No matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids
They'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down
The more my price goes up
[Chorus]
Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity

[Bridge]
So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of the fun and the sun
We'll be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
Hey hey, Hollywood, here we come

[Chorus]
Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV

Being a celebrity
Yeah celebrity

Every other, every other time

I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
But I just laugh about it
'Cause she's always playin' those games, come on

Deep down I know she loves me
But she's got a funny way of showin' me how she cares
Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn
And drove out with one finger in the air, oh yeah

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Sometimes we sit around
Just the two of us, on the park bench
Sometimes we swim around
Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts
But then I think about the time
When we broke up before the prom
And you told everyone that I was gay
Okay

Sometimes I walk around the town
For hours just to settle down
But I take you back and you kick me down
'Cause that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Keep it up home girl, don't you quit
You know the way you scream is the ultimate
And when I walk away, just watch the clock
I bet I don't even get around the block

I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
One day we'll laugh about it
'Cause we're always playin' those games, every other time
Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Keep it up homegirl, don't you quit

It's like jumping it's like leaping
It's like walking on the ceiling
It's like floating
It's like flying through the air

It's like soaring
It's like gliding
It's a rocket ship you're riding
It's a feeling that can take you anywhere

[Chorus:]
So why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
I don't know

There was passion
There was laughter
The first morning after
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground

Every time we were together
We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
But you can't live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down

[Verse 3:]
It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon

It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new

Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling

It's not a diss song, it's just a real song
Uh, you feel me? Uh
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so, make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one
[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (you lost one)
Story of a champion
Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth
To be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one
[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (oh yeah, she lost one)
Story of a champion
Sorry I'm a champion
You lost one
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)
Story of a champion
Colleek, you're a champion
I lost one20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Verse]
Wie viel Wert hat eine Nacht mit den Jungs?
Wie viel bedeutet dir die Stadt nur für uns?
Ist schon komisch was auf einmal von Bedeutung ist
Es reicht vollkommen wenn du Nachts noch unter Freunden bist

Ich nehm' ein Schluck von meiner Mische auf dem Weg da hin
50 Prozent voll am Arsch, 50 % mittendrin
Und ich bin froh wie es ist, und bin froh wie es war
Und alle schreien in die Nacht: ""Wir sind wieder da!""

This just can't be summer love
Pump' Justin Timberlake
Ich bin verliebt in diesen Sommer weil er wieder lebt
Schließ die Augen, Kopf nach oben, atme diese Ruhe
War ganz schön lange still doch heute Nacht ist es was Gutes
Sag mir, wie gut fühlt sich diese Sonne an
Sag mir, wie gut fühlt sich dieser Mond an
Sag mir, wie gut fühlt sich dieser Song an
Und sei ehrlich, wie gut fühlt sich dieser Sommer an

Und vielleicht find' ich Liebe diesen Sommer
Ja, wer weis was so passiert in diesem Sommer
In diesem ersten echten Sommer

[Verse]
Ich blas' den Rauch aus, seh' den Mond durch das Grau
Es fühlt sich seltsam an, die Nacht so schön laut
Die ganze Welt wird von schwarz langsam zu blau
Und alles fühlt sich seltsam fremd an und doch vertraut
Die Sonne scheint durch das Fenster spür' Sie im Gesicht
Die Vögel singen, Blumen blühen, alles so schön schlicht
Das ist die Hymne für den Sommer deines Lebens
Und alles was passiert wirst du so nie mehr erleben

Keine Summertime Sadness, bin nicht Lana Del Rey
Und ich lieb' dieses Game
Und ich hab vielleicht schon vieles gesehn'
Doch diesen Sommer schlaf' ich nicht, nein ich leb

Sag mir, wie gut fühlt sich diese Sonne an
Sag mir, wie gut fühlt sich dieser Mond an
Sag mir, wie gut fühlt sich dieser Song an
Und sei ehrlich, wie gut fühlt sich dieser Sommer an

Und vielleicht find' ich Liebe diesen Sommer

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancin' the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop
'Cause tonight's the night
It goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes (I'm seein' stars)

Now the record always spins on the trails we blaze
The walls are closin' in, but that's okay

And it feels so good, so good, I'm on top of the world
The coolest kid in the neighborhood

[Verse 3]
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life

Icein', mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones
'Cause what we are, is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun
Come on the fun is just begun

We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine
